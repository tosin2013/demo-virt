= Network Settings as Kustomize Components

Use the link:../../templates[templates] to generate network configs and commit the rendered manifests for application with Kustomize.

Do not apply these directly, but reference them as components in your overlay. Eg link:../overlays/homelab/kustomization.yaml[]

The link:br-vmdata[br-vmdata] should be used once to configure the bridge at the cluster level.

All other VLANs are attached to this bridge at a namespace level. Specifically the 'default' namespace.

Note that each component may have a Linux bridge and an OVS bridge option. OVS is preferred.
